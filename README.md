UtilityBox

UtilityBox is a collection of useful functions that can be used in various programming projects. This repository includes three main files: DoubleIntegrator.py, BasisFunctionGenerator.py, and PointInTriangle.py.

DoubleIntegrator.py

DoubleIntegrator.py contains a class called DoubleIntegrator, which is used to calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object moving in two dimensions. This class can be used in robotics applications or any other application that requires the calculation of position, velocity, and acceleration over time.

BasisFunctionGenerator.py

BasisFunctionGenerator.py contains a class called BasisFunctionGenerator, which is used to generate basis functions for data analysis and machine learning applications. This class includes several different types of basis functions, such as polynomial, radial, and Fourier basis functions.

PointInTriangle.py

PointInTriangle.py contains a function called PointInTriangle, which is used to determine whether a given point is inside a 3D triangle or not. This function is useful for applications that require the calculation of the intersection of a point with a 3D object.

Conclusion

UtilityBox is a versatile collection of functions that can be used in a wide range of programming applications. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact the repository owner. Thank you for using UtilityBox!
